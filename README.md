## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project I familiarized myself with the forEach() function and its' quirks and solidified my flexbox skills as well.

### Continued development

I'm working towards making a chat app and I believe this project will make it easier for me to implement a notification page feature in it.
